# Contextual AI Professional Assistant

## Project Description (Draft)

**Description:**  
This project is an AI-driven application designed to serve as a dynamic assistant that adapts to different professional roles based on the context it receives.  
Unlike traditional digital assistants limited to scheduling or reminders, this system can function as a lawyer, accountant, researcher, or consultantâ€”depending on the data provided.  

The assistant leverages:  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ground responses in relevant documents.  
- **Database integration** for structured queries and knowledge retrieval.  
- **Function calling** for executing precise tasks and workflows.  
- **Conversational and agentic AI** for multi-step reasoning and decision-making.  

**Architecture:**  
- **Backend:** Java with Spring Boot for scalability, API endpoints, and orchestration of AI services.  
- **Frontend:** React with JavaScript for a responsive and intuitive user experience.  

**Goal:**  
Create a versatile AI assistant that can fluidly adapt to professional contexts, reducing repetitive work and providing trustworthy, context-aware support in diverse domains.
